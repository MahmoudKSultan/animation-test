        "Between the silent mountains and the eternal spring, the beginning of a story.",
        "In a small town nestled between quiet mountains that seem to guard an ancient secret, the sands tell the story of a mother who ran between two mountains 4,000 years ago. She carried in her heart a thirst greater than that of her small child crying in her arms. Only the wind howled between the mountains, as if mourning the absence of life. There she stood between survival and extinction. On the seventh run, the earth opened its heart, as if the heavens had heard the child's cry, and water burst forth from beneath his feet. Water became life, and life became a message.",
        "Later, the father returned to find the water had become a reality in a barren land. He decided with his son to build a house surrounding the water, a house that became the nucleus attracting people from all over to see this ancient home and drink from its waters, which still quench the thirsty to this day!",
        "In this town was the birthplace of Samir. He was born in narrow alleys, into a modest family. Being the eldest of his eight siblings, he bore the weight of the family on his shoulders from a young age.",
        "Every morning began with the sight of the sun breaking into his small room, as if whispering to him: 'Rise; the world is bigger than your small town, and life is farther than the sun.'",
        "He was forced to leave his childhood behind, carrying a bag of hope and disappointments.",
        "Samir grew up, studying during the day and working at night, weaving dreams within himself like distant clouds he could see but were beyond his reach. Over time, he married and had two children. The needs of his large and small family grew, while their limited resources barely covered the basics.",
        "By the time he turned thirty, Samir realized he had to leave, as a river leaves to find the sea. He carried his determination and traveled to Riyadh, where the skies are wider and dreams are bigger.",
        "It was the hardest decision of his life: to leave his family and sacred city, which people visit from all over the world, and head to Saudi Arabia's capital, where the biggest transformation stories of the 21st century are made.",
        "There, he met his friend Majid, a man with a generous heart and deep faith who believed in Samir's ambition and determination to succeed. Majid invested one million riyals in Samir—a sum that millions of young people around the world dream of. He saw it as the beginning of a dream. But, just as the wind can devour sails, the money vanished at the start of their project during the historic COVID-19 pandemic. The dream quickly turned into a nightmare, and the loss was painful. The burden of letting down his friend weighed on his chest like a heavy rock.",
        "On a dark night, as he sat alone, his reflection appeared in a glass of water in his hands. He saw a weary face, but his eyes said something else. He remembered his mother patiently sewing fabrics and his father, who never stopped working.",
        "At that moment, he decided to stop breaking down. He started anew in marketing, a profession like the wind that carries ideas among people slowly and steadily. Hope began to blossom in his heart like an ancient tree sprouting new leaves after drought. With a fiery spirit, he began planting small seeds on the soil of experience, watering them with his sweat and determination.",
        "Over time, the harvest began, and life started smiling at him. His large family stabilized, his children attended good schools, and his wife’s smile returned. He worked at what he loved and excelled at, providing a decent life. Yet, he knew this was not everything; the ambition within him was a river seeking its estuary.",
        "The phrase that ignited the dream: One day, he listened to his country's transformation leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, say: 'We try to work only with dreamers who want to create something new in this world.' He felt these words were written for him, shaking the mountains within him. The message felt like a personal challenge!",
        "He decided to follow his dream to where answers could be found, inspired by the ancient Arab wisdom: 'Seek knowledge even if it is in China.' He packed his bag and traveled for the first time to China, the land of misty mountains and continuously flowing rivers, a land of dreams and hard work. He spent ten days between Guangzhou’s markets and Beijing’s towers, meeting souls with stories similar to his and discovering a culture with shared values between Chinese and Arab traditions.",
        "There, amidst meetings and reflections, an idea emerged like a golden egg: a project to market the rich Saudi culture and attract visitors from the great Chinese nation.",
        "While contemplating his next step, he remembered the story of Jack Ma, the Chinese man who started from nothing. When he pitched his simple idea to Japanese investor Masayoshi Son, the latter said: 'I don’t know why I trust you, but I believe in your dreams.' Son invested $20 million in Alibaba, which today is an empire worth billions.",
        "Inspired by this story, Samir returned to Riyadh with a genuine dream to write a new chapter in his story. He met his friend Majid and presented the golden egg, saying: 'I promise to compensate your initial investment manifold in the coming years and to work diligently on our project. I’ve learned lessons from past experiences, and now the vision is clear.'",
        "This was the beginning of the story. Just as his ancestor built a home by the eternal spring thousands of years ago, Samir hopes to build a new bridge of values and culture, connecting Saudi Arabia and China for a better life for future generations. For Samir, Saudi Arabia is not just a huge market or an ancient land; it is a great story to be told, with an open invitation for the world to discover the essence of authentic Arab culture and the great Saudi ambition.",
        "A special invitation: If you are reading this story in China, remember that dreams know no boundaries of place or time. Just as water was the beginning of life in a barren land, your visit to Saudi Arabia may be the start of a new story that inspires the world. Saudi Arabia and its hospitable people eagerly await your arrival."
